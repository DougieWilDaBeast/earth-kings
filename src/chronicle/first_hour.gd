class_name FirstHour
extends RefCounted
## What the First Hour leaves out (D95, D97).
##
## Scope is frozen on the First Hour until it plays from the crater to floor 5.
## Everything on the producer's cut list stays built but out of reach, behind one
## block of switches in `data/world_rules.json` → `first_hour.hidden`. Taking a
## name out of that list brings its system back; nothing is deleted.


## Whether [param feature] is hidden for now. Names: coliseum, training, museum,
## trivia, grimoires, ferries, captivity, nemesis, dispatch, seasons.
static func hides(feature: String) -> bool:
	return (Database.world_rules.get("first_hour", {}).get("hidden", []) as Array).has(feature)
